Credibility? Quality? Good Service? In short, an unforgettable overall experience. But as a brand, how can you ensure this? Let’s go by the book and say that we need to deliver WOW moments to our customers. So even if they are here only for a good experience, a WOW experience is surely going to impress\\nthem to the core.\\n\\nIt is a tried and tested white-glove service approach that has been specifically designed to keep customers coming back to you while making them shameless fans for life who’ll recommend you to more clients. And as they say,a little appreciation goes a long way. The same is the case with the word of mouth.\\n\\nBut creating WOW moments is not as easy as it may sound since it requires you to take care of even the tiniest needs of your customers. You need to make your customers feel like the most important people in your world, i.e., the VIPs. Let them know, if need be, you’ll bend over backward to make their day better, even if you are not flexible at all. Because at the end of the day, it is all about the overall customer experience—and the details in between.\\n\\nNow, when was the last time you experienced a WOW moment at a business, the one\\nwhich you remember explicitly with all the details, the one which impressed you made you go like: this is really nice? The business actually did a lot more business there when it impressed you, making you tell your friends and business associates about it. Wouldn’t you like the same for your business?!

Doing what you say you’ll do shows how much you care about your customers. It becomes a piece of cake when you’re dedicated enough to build systems around WOW moments. When your aim at impressing customers, the ways to go the extra mile will make their way to you on their own. Just make sure that your entire team is on board with the same idea that they all follow up and meet their deadlines, so details don’t fall between the cracks.\\n\\nGiving your customers more than their expectations will be a gift, and who doesn’t like gifts!

But to accept those errors and fix them is celestial (well, at least metaphorically). If you don’t know how to handle your customers properly, it is going to reflect negatively on your customer satisfaction, retention, and business success.\\n\\nNightmare customer service, where the experience is so much poor that we tend to take it for granted at times, is rampant in the marketplace. That’s crazy, totally crazy! Why would someone spend their money on a company that doesn’t even care about its customers.

Everyone (literally every one) in your team has to put their best foot forward and must be on top of their game at all times in case you want to improve the customer experience. It includes embracing the feedback from the clients, even if it is too negative. Try to understand their perspective and how it can be changed.\\n\\nGetting customer feedback not only helps you gain a better understanding of your market but also the competition.

In such cases, it is not wise to spend any energy on retaining them. You need to learn when to let them walk away. Sometimes, you might even have to fire a client, which is a critical decision since your business depends (to some extend or more) on the income from that client.\\n\\nIt is quite difficult for most business owners to let bad customers or clients go. All thanks to the fear of the loss of income or the feelings of failure. You may want to stick with the client hoping that things will get better with time, but it rarely is the case.

It takes a lot of time, money, and effort to chase down new customers. All of these efforts go to waste if you lose them after the first or second transaction because you (as a business) don’t follow up or follow through after the sale. Customers are likely to go to your competitors instead of coming back to you if they don’t feel appreciated.\\nHence, it is important to follow up with existing customers since it is where\\nthe money is!\",\"marks\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"data\":{}},{\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\",\"content\":[{\"nodeType\":\"text\",\"value\":\"\\n\\n\",\"marks\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"data\":{}},{\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\",\"content\":[{\"nodeType\":\"text\",\"value\":\" \",\"marks\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"data\":{}},{\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\",\"content\":[{\"nodeType\":\"text\",\"value\":\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\"marks\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"data\":{}},{\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\",\"content\":[{\"nodeType\":\"text\",\"value\":\"\",\"marks\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"data\":{}}]}"},"image":{"fluid":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/a05jrshjvgmj/3LO1YBMNvqBRCUKGLrkX4z/ba779db2d569cf1c28f745c6f53b36b0/blg_img.jpg?w=800&q=50"}},"title":"How to Deliver WOW Moments and Make Your Customers Feel Valued?","slug":"technology-trends-in-manufacturing-industry-for-2021"},{"description":{"raw":"{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"description\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"heading-1\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"}],\"nodeType\":\"document\"}"},"image":{"fluid":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/a05jrshjvgmj/5fa4czqSfWze94ERsGLefG/ac1d2bc612b976cea7a686f46172458c/cod-warzone-system-requirements-900x506.png?w=800&q=50"}},"title":"jorden","slug":"latest"},{"description":{"raw":"{\"nodeType\":\"document\",\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"nodeType\":\"heading-1\",\"content\":[{\"nodeType\":\"text\",\"value\":\"This is Checking\",\"marks\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"data\":{}},{\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\",\"content\":[{\"nodeType\":\"text\",\"value\":\"t\",\"marks\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"nodeType\":\"text\",\"value\":\"his is paragraph\",\"marks\":[{\"type\":\"underline\"}],\"data\":{}}],\"data\":{}},{\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\",\"content\":[{\"nodeType\":\"text\",\"value\":\"i dasdasd\",\"marks\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"data\":{}},{\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\",\"content\":[{\"nodeType\":\"text\",\"value\":\"\",\"marks\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"data\":{}}]}"},"image":{"fluid":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/a05jrshjvgmj/6kGtLYT8HUpUH4Vs30W7hA/cff4d8e210fe75acacda3a8ae2e7796d/team.png?w=800&q=50"}},"title":"last title checking","slug":"last-title-checking"},{"description":{"raw":"{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[{\"type\":\"bold\"}],\"value\":\"Sub - Head\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"},{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"\\n\\nt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.

It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \\\"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\\\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \\\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\\\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\\n\\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \\\"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\\\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.
